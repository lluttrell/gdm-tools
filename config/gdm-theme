# This file can be used to set variables used by gdm-theme
# Use this file with caution. It may break program 'gdm-theme'.

# Sometimes distros like Manjaro put the default gresource file with a different name
# and put their custom/modified theme's gresource file as the default gresource file.
# Following variable tells gdm-theme to use provided gresource file as default instead
# of what is present at the default location.
# On Manjaro it will be
# defaultGresource=/usr/share/gnome-shell/gnome-shell-theme.gresource.old
